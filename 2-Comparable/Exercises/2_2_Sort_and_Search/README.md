# Exercise 2.2 - üîç Sort & Search

## üéØ Objectives

- **Sort** a collection of `Comparable` objects.
- **Trace** the binary search algorithm.
- **Find** a particular object in collection of `Comparable` objects using binary search.

## üîç Context

By implementing a `Comparable` class in the previous exercise, we got sorting for free! 
> Any container of objects can be sorted, if the objects can be compared to each other.

Once the data is sorted, we can use binary search to search for a particular element 
in the collection.

## üö¶ Let's Go

1. Our task is to refactor the integer binary search from the notes to use our `Pokemon` comparable class instead.
   - The end goal is to `Pokemon.binary_search()` for any Pokemon that may exist in our collection.
   - You can use the unit tests located in [`test_pokemon.py`](./test_pokemon.py) to verify that the search is working correctly.
2. Now that we can (efficiently) search for a `Pokemon` in our collection, we want to be able to add a Pokemon from our `collection` to our `team` using the `Pokemon.add_to_team()` method.
   - The "collection" is the set of all Pokemon we might have in storage.
   - The "team" is the set of (max) 6 Pokemon that we can carry at any one point.
   - `Pokemon.add_to_team()` should:
     1. Search (using binary search, of course) for the Pokemon we want and get the index of where the Pokemon is in the collection.
     2. If the Pokemon does not exist in the collection, then raise a `PokemonNotFoundError`.
     3. Otherwise, add the Pokemon from the collection to the team.
        - You don't have to worry about removing the Pokemon from the collection.
