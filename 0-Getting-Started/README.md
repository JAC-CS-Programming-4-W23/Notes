# üå± Getting Started

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Explain** what is a data structure and an algorithm.
2. **Install and set up** a basic Python project using the PyCharm Community Edition IDE.
3. **Print** "Hello World" to the console.
4. **Review** basic OOP concepts.

## üöò Data Structures & Algorithms

What is a data structure?
- **Data structure**: A way to represent and model a collection of _values_ that are subject to a set of _rules_.
  - **Values**: All the people in their cars at a fast food drive-thru
  - **Rules**: The first customer that ordered gets their food first, new customers have to start at the back of the line

What is an Algorithm?
- **Algorithm**: A _sequence_ of operations to complete a _task_.
  - **Task**: Ordering food at a fast food represent
  - **Sequence**:
    1. Give your order to the employee at the cash register
    2. Pay for your order
    3. Wait for your order to be prepared
    4. Receive your order

## üçé Mac Tips

Since we'll be working in the Mac lab this semester, it's important to know a few things about Macs specifically:

### Key Shortcuts

- Many shortcuts are the same as Windows if you swap <kbd>‚åÉ Control</kbd> for <kbd>‚åò Command</kbd>. For example, <kbd>‚åÉ</kbd> <kbd>C</kbd> on Windows is <kbd>‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> on Mac.
- `CMD + SPACE` brings up the spotlight search. You can type anything after this and it will search for it on the computer. It's my preferred method for opening applications.
- `CMD + TAB` swaps between applications, similar to `ALT + TAB` on Windows.
- ``` CMD + ` ``` swaps between windows of the same application. For example, if you have multiple Word documents open, you can swap between them with this shortcut.

### Behaviour

Maximizing Windows:
- Maximizing windows does not work like you're probably used to. If you click the green maximize button on a window, it will make that application full screen. Full screen can be useful at time, but what you probably want instead is to simply **double click the titlebar of the window** which will make it take up the entire height and width of the monitor, similar to Windows.

Scroll directions
- MAC's by default scroll according to the idea that if you scroll up, you are actually pushing a piece of paper up.  This is the exact opposite of Windwos.
  - to change this behaviour to be the same as Windows, bring up the spotlight search (`CMD + SPACE`), search and select "mouse", and uncheck "natural scrolling".

### Screenshots

- You can take and store a **screenshot** to your clipboard with `CMD + CTRL + SHIFT + 4`. You can then paste (`CMD + V`) the screenshot into an email, Teams message, etc.
- If you need the actual image file of the screenshot, `CMD + SHIFT + 4` will save the image to your Desktop.
- If you want to take a screenshot of an entire window, add `SPACE` to any of the above commands.

## üî® Setup

1. Download and install [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download) for your OS if it's not already installed.
