## ✒️ Course Description

Welcome to Programming 4! We are really excited to teach and learn the fundamentals of data structure and algorithms 
with you. One of the major differences between novice and expert programmers is their knowledge and 
usage of well-known data structures and algorithms in the programs they write. Knowing the 
trade-offs between the time certain algorithms take and how much space certain data structures use 
can make a huge difference in the performance of your programs. It can be as significant as your 
program taking minutes to run versus seconds!

In this course, you will build on all the knowledge of programming you've gained so far in the 
Computer Science program. Basic data structures, lists, maps and sets, will be studied. You will 
gain a deeper understanding of how object-oriented solutions are designed and implemented, 
specifically _when_ and _how_ specific programming techniques are useful. These topics include 
**generics**, **inheritance and polymorphism**, **recursion**, 
**lambda expressions** and **higher-order functions**, as well as simple 
**software design patterns**. 

You will use object-oriented programming to model a database environment and produce a software 
library. The programming language will be [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.11/).
