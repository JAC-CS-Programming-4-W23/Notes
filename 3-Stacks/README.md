# ü•û Stacks

## üéØ Objectives

- **Explain** the stack data structure.
- **Design** a stack data structure.
- **Solve** a problem using a stack.
- **Implement** a stack data structure in Java.

## ‚Ü™Ô∏è Last in, First out

![Speed Stacking](./images/1-Speed-Stacking.gif "Is speed stacking still a thing?")

A stack is a *collection* of data. We refer to individual data items in the collection as *elements*.

A stack is a **LIFO** collection: the *last* element added to the stack is the *first* element to leave.

Let's draw a stack like this:

![Stack diagram](./images/stack1.png)

- **bottom:** the element at the "lowest" possible position in the stack.
- **empty:** where there are no elements in the stack.
- **top:** the element at the "highest" possible position in the stack.
- **capacity:** the maximum number of elements in the stack.

## üìê Stack Design

For every operation we design we will consider:

1. A description of what the operation accomplishes.
2. What the operation is called, what are it's inputs and outputs. This is called the *signature*.
3. What are the operation's *preconditions*, that is, what condition is required to be met in order to call the method.
4. What are the operation's *postconditions*, that is, what are the expected changes  the object when the operation is called.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Exercise 3.1 - Stack Design

Let's start by designing a stack that holds `int` values, only for now.

A *push* operation adds an element to the top of the stack.

A *pop* operation removes an element from the top of the stack.

| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Stack underflow](./images/stack4.png "Possible problem of popping.") | ![Stack overflow](./images/stack5.png "Possible problem of pushing.") |

| `push()`     |                                         |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Description  | Add an element to the top of the stack. |
| Signature    | `void push(int element)`                |
| Precondition | Stack is not full.                      |
| Mutator      | Yes.                                    |
| Returns      | -                                       |

Can return `boolean` but what happens when we implement `pop()`?

| `pop()`      |                                                |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Description  | Remove an element from the stack.              |
| Signature    |                                                |
| Precondition | Stack is not empty.                            |
| Mutator      | Yes.                                           |
| Returns      | The element removed from the top of the stack. |

| `top()`      |                                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Description  | Get the top element of the stack. |
| Signature    |                                   |
| Precondition | Stack is not empty.               |
| Mutator      | No.                               |
| Returns      | The top element is returned.      |

| `isEmpty()`  |                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Description  | Check if the stack is empty.                     |
| Signature    |                                                  |
| Precondition | None.                                            |
| Mutator      | No.                                              |
| Returns      | `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise. |

| `isFull()`   |                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Description  | Check if the stack is full.                     |
| Signature    |                                                 |
| Precondition | None.                                           |
| Mutator      | No.                                             |
| Returns      | `true` if the stack is full, `false` otherwise. |

!> "Stack exists" precondition: the existence of the object is required for all operations so we will omit it as a precondition. It will be considered incorrect on test.

- Alternate design: `size()` and `getCapacity()`.

## üçî APIs

You've probably heard the term "API" get thrown around in computer science. What does it mean exactly?

One analogy could be ordering from a menu:

![Ordering](./images/2-Ordering.gif "Never change, Big Smoke, never change.")

The restaurant's menu is like its API. The menu is there to tell you what you're allowed to order at the restaurant. You can **only** order things that are listed on the menu, and **nothing else**.

API = [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API)

?> In contrast to a user interface, which connects a computer to a person, an application programming interface connects computers or pieces of software to each other.

It's in the name - **interface**! Recall that in OOP, an interface acts as a contract. The implementing class **must** override all methods included in the interface. Because of this contract-like behaviour, it means that any code (i.e. customer) that needs to use the implementing class (i.e. restaurant) knows what methods it will have due to the interface (i.e. menu).

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Exercise 3.2 - Paired Brackets

Using just the Stack API, (pseudo) code a method `hasPairedBrackets` that uses a stack to determine if brackets `( )`, `{ }`, `[ ]` and `< >` are properly *paired*: each opened bracket is closed but only after subsequent opened brackets are closed.

Good: `()`, `([])`, `<[]()>`, `((()))`, etc.
Bad: `(`, `(]`, `{[}]`, `<<>`, `<>>`, etc.

If we ignore non-bracket characters, these would also be accepted:

Good: `<html>`, `(a[bc]?)`, `(you (should learn (lisp)))`, etc.
